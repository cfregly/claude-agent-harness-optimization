# OpenWork UI MCP Guardrail PR Packet

Share link: [OpenWork UI MCP Guardrail full PR/evidence bundle](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/evals/pr_packets/openwork_ui_mcp_guardrail_2026-06-28)

## Summary

The table below is the exact handoff text. Baseline / before is the current behavior. Suggested / after is the proposed wording or behavior to implement.

| Suggested change | Baseline / before description | Suggested / after description | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| No wording change promoted from this slice. | The retained MCP surface already passed every tested tool-selection case. | No tool or wording change is promoted. Keep current behavior and retain the cases as regression coverage. | `source_tuned_openwork_ui_mcp` also scored 1.000. Keep the cases as regression coverage. |


## Result

Current frontier stress receipt: 28 current available-frontier cells, 27 passed, 0 failed, 1 error on OpenAI `gpt-5.5` and Gemini `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools`. Treat this as hill-descending coverage for the next tuning pass.

Anthropic Opus frontier receipt: 14 Anthropic Opus cells, 14 passed, 0 failed, 0 errors on accessible `claude-opus-4-8`. Any failed cells are model-selection findings, not provider-credit blockers.

Guardrail. No upstream change is promoted because the baseline already passed the tested slice.

The live Anthropic prompt JSON run kept both docs-level and source-tuned variants at 7/7, so the packet is guardrail evidence rather than a promoted change.

## Why This Matters

- Value proposition: avoid spending founder or engineering time on a wording change that did not beat the current surface.
- No promoted delta from this slice; both variants were already passing.
- The retained cases are still useful regression coverage for future changes.
- Downside avoided: shipping unproven wording changes while the current behavior is already passing.

## Recommended Actions

- No upstream change is promoted from this slice.
- Keep the selected cases below as regression coverage because both variants already passed.
- Run the local-agent prompt below to decide where those regression cases belong if this area changes.
