## Summary

The table below is the exact handoff text. Baseline / before is the current behavior. Suggested / after is the proposed wording or behavior to implement.

| Suggested change | Baseline / before description | Suggested / after description | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Clarify browser alias and safety-mode skill routing boundaries. | Agents could confuse browser/headless aliases or careful-mode versus other safety-mode skills. | Clarify browser/headless aliases and safety or careful-mode skill boundaries before the agent selects a skill. | `gstack_boundary_tuned_skill_descriptions` scored 0.992, a 0.017 gain. Add retained cases as regression coverage. |


## Result

Current frontier stress receipt: 496 current available-frontier cells, 484 passed, 8 failed, 4 errors on OpenAI `gpt-5.5` and Gemini `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools`. Treat this as hill-descending coverage for the next tuning pass.

Anthropic Opus frontier receipt: 248 Anthropic Opus cells, 0 passed, 0 failed, 248 errors. The new key passed smoke testing, then later Anthropic calls hit credit exhaustion where shown in the receipt.

Confirmed improvement. This clears the adversarially-confirmed to add value bar.

The tuned gstack skill descriptions improved the 720-cell live matrix from 0.975 to 0.992, with
the remaining packet evidence preserved for reruns and upstream review.

## Why This Matters

- Value proposition: helps agents choose the intended gstack workflow instead of adjacent tools that look plausible.
- Proof: `gstack_boundary_tuned_skill_descriptions` scored 0.992, a 0.017 gain.
- Proof scope: 720 live matrix cells on the same tasks, providers, harnesses, and instruction variants.
- Baseline failure pattern: careful-mode, browser-headless.
- Downside avoided: plausible-but-wrong tool choices that waste time or return misleading results.

## Recommended Actions

- Apply suggested change: Clarify browser alias and safety-mode skill routing boundaries.
- Add the selected cases below to repo CI or release-blocking regression coverage.
- Run the local-agent prompt below in your repo to identify exact files, patch locations, tests, and risks before editing.
