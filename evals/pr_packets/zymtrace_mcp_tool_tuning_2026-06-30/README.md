## Summary

The table below is the exact handoff text. Baseline / before is the current behavior. Suggested / after is the proposed wording or behavior to implement.

| Suggested change | Baseline / before description | Suggested / after description | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Encode the profiling workflow: prefer MCP resources for `topfunctions`, `topentities`, and `flamegraph`. Use project UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` unless the user names another project. Discover metrics before GPU or inference metric queries. Use rank-first CPU tools. Fetch full traces only after a selected `prefix_hash`. | Agents could skip resource-first lookup, use `project_id: "default"`, query GPU or inference metrics before discovery, or fetch full traces before selecting a `prefix_hash`. | Use MCP resources first for `topfunctions`, `topentities`, and `flamegraph`. Use the default project UUID unless another project is named. Discover metrics before GPU or inference queries. Rank CPU traces before full trace fetches. Fetch full trace only after a selected `prefix_hash`. | `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` scored 1.000, a 0.417 gain. Add retained cases as regression coverage. |
| Add an explicit idle-exclusion option or marker for optimization-oriented `hot_traces` discovery. | `hot_traces` can rank an `IDLE` trace first for optimization-oriented discovery. | Add idle exclusion or an explicit idle marker for optimization-oriented `hot_traces` discovery before traces are ranked. | `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` scored 1.000, a 0.417 gain. Add retained cases as regression coverage. |
| Add a server-side option or marker that keeps `zymtrace-profiler` from being presented as an optimization target in `topentities`. | `topentities` can expose `zymtrace-profiler` as if it were an application optimization target. | Filter or mark `zymtrace-profiler` in `topentities` so profiler self-noise is not presented as an application optimization target. | `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` scored 1.000, a 0.417 gain. Add retained cases as regression coverage. |
| Add a small read-only GPU readiness resource that reports GPU support, GPU metric collection, detected GPU names, and CUDA library extraction state without exposing the license value. | GPU support, GPU metric collection, detected GPU names, and CUDA library extraction state are scattered across logs and metric surfaces. | Expose one read-only GPU readiness resource with `supports_gpu`, `gpu_metrics_enabled`, detected GPU names, and CUDA library extraction status without exposing the license value. | `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` scored 1.000, a 0.417 gain. Add retained cases as regression coverage. |


## Result

Current frontier stress receipt: 272 current available-frontier cells, 233 passed, 27 failed, 12 errors on OpenAI `gpt-5.5` and Gemini `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools`. Treat this as hill-descending coverage for the next tuning pass.

Anthropic Opus frontier receipt: 136 Anthropic Opus cells, 118 passed, 18 failed, 0 errors on accessible `claude-opus-4-8`. Any failed cells are model-selection findings, not provider-credit blockers.

Confirmed improvement. This clears the adversarially-confirmed to add value bar.

The tuned Zymtrace MCP boundary rules moved the selected held-out prompt JSON cells from 14/24
stock passes to 24/24 tuned passes across Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini.

## Why This Matters

- Value proposition: helps agents choose the intended Zymtrace MCP workflow instead of adjacent tools that look plausible.
- Proof: `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` scored 1.000, a 0.417 gain.
- Proof scope: 48 live matrix cells on the same tasks, providers, harnesses, and instruction variants.
- Baseline failure pattern: default project metrics discovery skips search, gpu inference workflow starts with metrics, selected trace drilldown is bounded, hot trace discovery is bounded.
- Downside avoided: plausible-but-wrong tool choices that waste time or return misleading results.

## Recommended Actions

- Apply suggested change: Encode the profiling workflow: prefer MCP resources for `topfunctions`, `topentities`, and `flamegraph`. Use project UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` unless the user names another project. Discover metrics before GPU or inference metric queries. Use rank-first CPU tools. Fetch full traces only after a selected `prefix_hash`.
- Add an explicit idle-exclusion option or marker for optimization-oriented `hot_traces` discovery.
- Add a server-side option or marker that keeps `zymtrace-profiler` from being presented as an optimization target in `topentities`.
- Add a small read-only GPU readiness resource that reports GPU support, GPU metric collection, detected GPU names, and CUDA library extraction state without exposing the license value.
- Add the selected cases below to repo CI or release-blocking regression coverage.

## Frontier Stress Result

The current frontier sweep was run after adding named frontier profiles to the Zymtrace matrix and
hardening the prompt-JSON parser for fenced, wrapped, and array-shaped model outputs.

OpenAI `gpt-5.5` and Gemini `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools` completed 272 live cells with
233 passed, 27 failed, and 12 errors. Treat this as hill-descending evidence for the next tuning
round, not as a replacement for the confirmed 24/24 held-out improvement.

Anthropic `claude-fable-5` was not available to the provided key. The accessible `claude-opus-4-8` rerun completed 136 cells with 118 passed, 18 failed, and 0 errors.
The all-provider attempt is retained here:
