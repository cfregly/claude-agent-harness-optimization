Suggested title: Tighten Zymtrace MCP retrieval routing with live evals

> [!NOTE]
> This page starts with the human summary. Detailed eval, command, and machine-readable material is preserved below.


## Value Proposition

- Helps agents choose the intended Zymtrace MCP workflow instead of adjacent tools that look plausible.
- `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` improved score from 0.583 to 1.000, a 0.417 gain over `stock_zymtrace_mcp`.
- The signal comes from 48 live matrix cells on a pinned source surface.
- Baseline mistakes clustered on default project metrics discovery skips search, gpu inference workflow starts with metrics, selected trace drilldown is bounded, hot trace discovery is bounded.
- The change clears the adversarially-confirmed value bar for this pinned evaluation.

## What Already Works

- The tested Zymtrace MCP surface is already strong: 38/48 live cells passed with 0 errors.
- The candidate score is 1.000, so this is a boundary tightening, not a broad rewrite.
- The packet keeps passing behavior visible so maintainers can see what does not need to change.

## How This Is Proven Useful

- The proof compares `stock_zymtrace_mcp` and `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` on the same tasks, providers, harnesses, and instruction variants.
- The measured delta is 0.417 against a required minimum of 0.010.
- The run contains 48 matrix cells, with 10 failures preserved as evidence instead of hand-waved examples.
- The source pin, exact cases, reproduction command, and result artifact are included so the claim can be rerun or challenged.

## Current Frontier Coverage

- No current frontier profile metadata is present in this result.
- Treat this packet as historical or compatibility evidence until rerun on current latest/frontier models and harness versions.
- Older-model wins should not be the headline if the ambiguity is fixed by newer model or harness behavior.

## Downside If Not Changed

- Ambiguous descriptions let plausible adjacent tools win, so failures look reasonable in transcripts even when the selected workflow is wrong.
- Model or harness upgrades can reintroduce the same mistake unless the boundary is encoded in descriptions and regression cases.
- Routing ambiguity can make agents choose broader or higher-cost tool paths instead of the narrow workflow the user asked for.

## Proposed change for Zymtrace MCP

Clarify default-project, GPU metrics-first, resource-first, and bounded hot-traces routing.

## Why

This change is backed by a harness matrix result, not a prose-only review. The bar is adversarially-confirmed to add value.

## Pinned surface

- default project id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
- docs: https://docs.zymtrace.com/getting-started/, https://docs.zymtrace.com/category/model-context-protocol-mcp/
- local MCP server: zymtrace-mcp 26.6.1
- local mcp url: http://localhost:8080/mcp
- resource count: 3
- resources: flamegraph, topfunctions, topentities
- skills: configure-zymtrace-mcp, optimize-cpu-workloads, optimize-gpu-workloads, optimize-memory-allocation
- tool count: 25
- target repo: https://github.com/zystem-io/zymtrace

## Result

- promoted by value bar: yes
- baseline variant: stock_zymtrace_mcp
- candidate variant: tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries
- baseline score: 0.583
- candidate score: 1.000
- delta: 0.417
- minimum delta: 0.010

## What We Learned

- `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` beat `stock_zymtrace_mcp` by 0.417 against a minimum delta of 0.010.
- Baseline mistakes clustered on these cases: default project metrics discovery skips search, gpu inference workflow starts with metrics, selected trace drilldown is bounded, hot trace discovery is bounded.
- The suggested change clears the adversarially-confirmed value bar for this pinned surface.
