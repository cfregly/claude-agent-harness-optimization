# Zymtrace MCP Frontier All-Provider Attempt - 2026-07-01

Passed: no
Live: yes

This is the retained historical all-provider frontier attempt. It includes Anthropic `claude-opus-4-8`, OpenAI `gpt-5.5`, and Gemini `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools`. The run is intentionally retained as descent evidence because the initial all-provider attempt hit Anthropic API-credit exhaustion and the frontier prompt-JSON harness exposed additional parser and routing failures. Current Anthropic MCP coverage is superseded by the separate Opus receipt with 118 passed, 18 failed, and 0 errors.

| Profile | Model | Passed | Failed | Errors |

## Blockers

- Anthropic `claude-fable-5` was unavailable to the provided key during smoke testing, so the all-provider attempt used accessible `claude-opus-4-8`.
- Historical note: Anthropic API-credit exhaustion stopped many `claude-opus-4-8` cells during the initial all-provider attempt. The separate current Opus receipt supersedes this Anthropic lane for MCP coverage.
- This all-provider attempt is not the promoted improvement receipt; it is retained failure-discovery evidence.
