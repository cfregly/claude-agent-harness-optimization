## Summary

The table below is the exact handoff text. Baseline / before is the current behavior. Suggested / after is the proposed wording or behavior to implement.

| Suggested change | Baseline / before description | Suggested / after description | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Encode the profiling workflow: prefer MCP resources for `topfunctions`, `topentities`, and `flamegraph`. Use project UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` unless the user names another project. Discover metrics before GPU or inference metric queries. Use rank-first CPU tools. Fetch full traces only after a selected `prefix_hash`. | Agents could skip resource-first lookup, use `project_id: "default"`, query GPU or inference metrics before discovery, or fetch full traces before selecting a `prefix_hash`. | Use MCP resources first for `topfunctions`, `topentities`, and `flamegraph`. Use the default project UUID unless another project is named. Discover metrics before GPU or inference queries. Rank CPU traces before full trace fetches. Fetch full trace only after a selected `prefix_hash`. | `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` scored 1.000, a 0.417 gain. Add retained cases as regression coverage. |
| Add an explicit idle-exclusion option or marker for optimization-oriented `hot_traces` discovery. | `hot_traces` can rank an `IDLE` trace first for optimization-oriented discovery. | Add idle exclusion or an explicit idle marker for optimization-oriented `hot_traces` discovery before traces are ranked. | `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` scored 1.000, a 0.417 gain. Add retained cases as regression coverage. |
| Add a server-side option or marker that keeps `zymtrace-profiler` from being presented as an optimization target in `topentities`. | `topentities` can expose `zymtrace-profiler` as if it were an application optimization target. | Filter or mark `zymtrace-profiler` in `topentities` so profiler self-noise is not presented as an application optimization target. | `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` scored 1.000, a 0.417 gain. Add retained cases as regression coverage. |
| Add a small read-only GPU readiness resource that reports GPU support, GPU metric collection, detected GPU names, and CUDA library extraction state without exposing the license value. | GPU support, GPU metric collection, detected GPU names, and CUDA library extraction state are scattered across logs and metric surfaces. | Expose one read-only GPU readiness resource with `supports_gpu`, `gpu_metrics_enabled`, detected GPU names, and CUDA library extraction status without exposing the license value. | `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` scored 1.000, a 0.417 gain. Add retained cases as regression coverage. |


## Result

Confirmed improvement. This clears the adversarially-confirmed to add value bar.

Current frontier stress receipt: 272 current available-frontier cells, 233 passed, 27 failed, 12 errors on OpenAI `gpt-5.5` and Gemini `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools`. Treat this as hill-descending coverage for the next tuning pass, not as a replacement for the promoted baseline-to-tuned result.

Anthropic Opus frontier receipt: 136 Anthropic Opus cells, 118 passed, 18 failed, 0 errors on accessible `claude-opus-4-8`. Any failed cells are model-selection findings, not provider-credit blockers.

The expanded held-out prompt JSON run moved from 4/8 to 8/8 on Anthropic, 5/8 to 8/8 on OpenAI, and
5/8 to 8/8 on Gemini. Across all three providers, stock passed 14/24 cells and tuned passed 24/24.

After the first live result, `matrix-coverage` exposed untested generated REST helpers. The hardened
matrix now has 34 cases, 25 of 25 expected-tool coverage, 25 of 25 forbidden-tool coverage, 85
boundary pairs, argument checks for every argument-taking expected tool, and `check_family` labels
for every case.

## What Failed

The stock descriptions usually picked the right broad tool, but missed required arguments and
workflow boundaries:

- default project metrics discovery used `project_id: "default"` instead of
  `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
- GPU inference investigation selected metric discovery but missed required metric-discovery
  arguments
- selected hot-trace drilldown did not consistently bind full trace fetches to a selected
  `prefix_hash` with `limit=1`
- first-pass hot-trace discovery did not consistently keep `meta_only=true` with a small limit
- one Gemini stock cell chose `hot_traces` instead of the resource fallback tool `topfunctions`

## Additional Live Findings

Unfiltered `hot_traces` can rank idle first. In the live smoke check, the first unfiltered CPU
`hot_traces` response returned an `IDLE` trace, and the ratio text referenced global non-idle time in
a way that exceeded 1.0. That is easy for agents to misread during first-pass optimization discovery.

`topentities` can expose profiler self-noise. The CPU resource returned `zymtrace-profiler` in the
top container list. The skills correctly tell agents to exclude the profiler from optimization
targets, but the resource output still makes it look selectable.

GPU readiness is spread across logs and metrics. After enablement, MCP showed GPU hardware metrics,
but there is no single MCP status path that reports GPU support, GPU metric collection, detected GPU
names, and CUDA library extraction state without exposing the license value.

## Why This Matters

- Value proposition: helps agents choose the intended Zymtrace MCP workflow instead of adjacent tools that look plausible.
- Proof: `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` scored 1.000, a 0.417 gain.
- Proof scope: 48 live matrix cells on the same tasks, providers, harnesses, and instruction variants.
- Baseline failure pattern: default project metrics discovery skips search, gpu inference workflow starts with metrics, selected trace drilldown is bounded, hot trace discovery is bounded.
- Downside avoided: plausible-but-wrong tool choices that waste time or return misleading results.

## Recommended Actions

- Apply suggested change: Encode the profiling workflow: prefer MCP resources for `topfunctions`, `topentities`, and `flamegraph`. Use project UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` unless the user names another project. Discover metrics before GPU or inference metric queries. Use rank-first CPU tools. Fetch full traces only after a selected `prefix_hash`.
- Add an explicit idle-exclusion option or marker for optimization-oriented `hot_traces` discovery.
- Add a server-side option or marker that keeps `zymtrace-profiler` from being presented as an optimization target in `topentities`.
- Add a small read-only GPU readiness resource that reports GPU support, GPU metric collection, detected GPU names, and CUDA library extraction state without exposing the license value.

## Frontier Stress Result

The 2026-07-01 frontier stress run used OpenAI `gpt-5.5` and Gemini
`gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools` across the full 34-case Zymtrace matrix, both tool variants,
and both instruction variants. It completed 272 live cells with 233 passed, 27 failed, and 12 errors.

This is descent evidence for the next tuning pass. It shows the latest frontier models still expose
edge cases around generated stats endpoints, JSON flamegraph-vs-rendered flamegraph boundaries, and
prompt-JSON output robustness.

Anthropic Opus coverage is retained separately in this packet. `claude-fable-5` remained unavailable to the provided key. The accessible `claude-opus-4-8` rerun completed 136 cells with 118 passed, 18 failed, and 0 errors.

## GPU Verification

The local single-host Docker Compose install was originally CPU-only in practice. The profiler had
GPU flags and NVML access, but the backend `ingest` and `web` services were started without
`ZYMTRACE_LICENSE_KEY`, so the profiler logs showed `SupportsGpu:false`.

After adding the commercial license to ignored `.env` files, recreating `ingest` and `web`, and
restarting the standalone profiler, live verification changed:

- backend ingest reported the license as valid through `2027-06-21 16:32:35 UTC`
- backend ingest reported license features `all`
- profiler reported `SupportsGpu:true`
- profiler detected `GPU device 0-0 (NVIDIA B200) supports GPM: true`
- profiler reported `Exporting GPU metrics`
- profiler extracted `libzymtracecudaprofiler.so` under `/var/lib/zymtrace/profiler`
- MCP metrics discovery found `hw.gpu.utilization`, memory, process memory, power, power limit,
  temperature, and clock-throttle metrics
- a PyTorch CUDA smoke process with `CUDA_INJECTION64_PATH` set logged `Intercepted zymtrace implant`

No license value is committed. The public sample only includes
`ZYMTRACE_LICENSE_KEY=replace-with-zymtrace-license-jwt`.
