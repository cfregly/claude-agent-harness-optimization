# OpenWork UI MCP Finding

Share link: [OpenWork packet](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/docs/findings/openwork)

## Human Summary

Send this as a guardrail packet for OpenWork. The tested UI bridge flow already selected the right
tools on the retained slice, so the useful artifact is the coverage case set rather than an upstream
change request.

## Full Bundle

- Reproduce: [OpenWork reproduce command](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/docs/findings/openwork#reproduce)

## Result

Guardrail. No upstream change is promoted.

The docs-level and source-tuned variants both passed 7/7 on Anthropic prompt JSON. That means this
did not clear the adversarially-confirmed to add value bar as an improvement, because there was no
baseline failure to fix.

## What Was Tested

The slice covered:

- bridge status checks
- current UI snapshot
- available action listing
- known action execution
- unknown action discovery before execution
- coordinate-click no-tool boundary
- app-closed status check
