# Public MCP Sweep

This sweep tests popular public MCP tool catalogs against the repo's
adversarially-confirmed to add value bar. A tuned description is not promoted just because it sounds
better. It has to beat the baseline on live model calls without introducing verifier tricks or
regressions.

> [!NOTE]
> This page starts with the human summary. Detailed eval, command, and machine-readable material is preserved below.

## Summary

| Target | Before | After | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Firecrawl MCP | `legacy_firecrawl_mcp` chose `firecrawl_extract` for one known URL plus structured fields. | Suggested change: Use `firecrawl_scrape` for one known page with specific fields. Reserve `firecrawl_extract` for broader extraction. | `tuned_firecrawl_mcp_boundaries` chose `firecrawl_scrape`. |
| Supabase MCP | `terse_supabase_database_mcp` chose `execute_sql` for DDL and RLS changes. | Suggested change: Route schema-changing SQL to `apply_migration`. Keep `execute_sql` for ordinary SQL. | `tuned_supabase_database_boundaries` chose `apply_migration`. |
| Zymtrace MCP | `stock_zymtrace_mcp` missed default-project and bounded-drilldown arguments. | Suggested change: Tighten default-project, resource-first, metrics-first, and bounded hot-trace routing. | `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` passed all retained held-out routing cases. |
| Screenpipe MCP | `readme_screenpipe_mcp` sent exact keyword lookup to `search-content`. | Suggested change: Route literal keyword or exact phrase lookup to `keyword-search`. | `source_tuned_screenpipe_mcp` sent it to `keyword-search`. |
| InsForge MCP | `readme_insforge_mcp` called `create-deployment` for a relative source path. | Suggested change: Require absolute deployment paths before calling `create-deployment`. | `source_tuned_insforge_mcp` rejected the request with `NO_TOOL`. |
| Humwork MCP | README-level descriptions passed 7/7. | No suggested wording change from this slice. No upstream change is promoted. | Skill-tuned descriptions also passed 7/7. Keep cases as guardrail coverage. |
| OpenWork UI MCP | Docs-level descriptions passed 7/7. | No suggested wording change from this slice. No upstream change is promoted. | Source-tuned descriptions also passed 7/7. Keep cases as guardrail coverage. |
| GitHub, Playwright, Slack, Filesystem, Postgres MCP Pro, Context7, ClickHouse | Stock descriptions passed or the apparent miss was a verifier/transient issue. | No suggested wording change from this slice. No upstream change is promoted. | Tuned descriptions did not produce a confirmed baseline delta. Keep cases as regression coverage. |

## What Cleared

GitHub, Playwright, Slack, Filesystem, Postgres MCP Pro, Context7, and ClickHouse did
not produce a confirmed tuning win on the current slices. Their stock descriptions either passed
outright or the apparent miss was an unfair verifier/transient issue.

Firecrawl produced a confirmed improvement:

- Legacy description: single known URL plus structured fields chose `firecrawl_extract`.
- Tuned description: the same task chose `firecrawl_scrape`.
- Rationale: current Firecrawl guidance says one known page with specific fields should use
  `firecrawl_scrape` with a focused JSON format. `firecrawl_extract` is better for multi-page or
  broader structured extraction jobs.
- Packet: [Firecrawl finding](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/docs/findings/firecrawl).

Supabase produced a confirmed improvement:

- Terse description: schema-changing SQL chose `execute_sql`.
- Tuned description: the same DDL and RLS policy tasks chose `apply_migration`.
- Rationale: Supabase schema changes should be tracked as migrations. `execute_sql` is for regular
  SQL that does not change schema.
- Packet: [Supabase finding](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/docs/findings/supabase).

Zymtrace produced a confirmed improvement:

- Stock descriptions with the Zymtrace skill rules chose the right tools for the held-out cases but
  missed required default-project and bounded-drilldown arguments.
- Tuned descriptions passed the same held-out default-project, GPU metrics-first, CPU rank-first,
  GPU call-tree, and selected-trace drilldown cases across Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini prompt JSON.
- Rationale: the live Zymtrace MCP server has resource-first/default-project rules, and the
  installed CPU/GPU skills add workflow constraints that must be present in the tool surface.
- Packet: [Zymtrace finding](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/docs/findings/zymtrace).

Screenpipe produced a confirmed improvement:

- README-level description: exact keyword lookup chose `search-content`.
- Source-level tuned description: the same task chose `keyword-search`.
- Rationale: Screenpipe has a dedicated keyword search tool for literal terms and exact phrases.
  Broader content search remains useful for transcript lines, screen text, speakers, windows, tags,
  and memories.
- Packet: [Screenpipe finding](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/docs/findings/screenpipe).

InsForge produced a confirmed improvement:

- README-level description: a relative source-directory deployment request chose
  `create-deployment`.
- Source-level tuned description: the same task chose `NO_TOOL`.
- Rationale: InsForge deployment requires an absolute `sourceDirectory`. Relative paths should be
  rejected before the deployment tool is called.
- Packet: [InsForge finding](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/docs/findings/insforge).

Humwork and OpenWork did not produce a confirmed tuning win on the current Anthropic slices. Their
public descriptions already routed the tested expert-consultation and UI-control cases correctly.
Packets: [Humwork guardrail](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/docs/findings/humwork)
and [OpenWork guardrail](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/docs/findings/openwork).

This is the useful pattern: do not broadly rewrite a tool catalog. Identify one ambiguous boundary,
write a realistic prompt that isolates it, and prove the tuned wording changes the next tool call.

## Live Results

Firecrawl full Anthropic prompt-JSON run:

- `legacy_firecrawl_mcp`: 11/12
- `tuned_firecrawl_mcp_boundaries`: 12/12

Firecrawl adversarial single-case run across provider and harness cells:

- Anthropic native tools: legacy failed, tuned passed.
- Anthropic prompt JSON: legacy failed, tuned passed.
- OpenAI native tools: legacy failed, tuned passed.
- OpenAI prompt JSON: legacy failed, tuned passed.
- Gemini native tools: legacy failed, tuned passed.
- Gemini prompt JSON: legacy failed, tuned passed.

The current Firecrawl MCP server already contains much of this boundary guidance. Treat the matrix
as a regression and migration test for older/terse descriptions, not as a claim that the current
server is broken.

Supabase adversarial DDL run:

- Anthropic native tools: terse 0/3, tuned 3/3.
- Anthropic prompt JSON: terse 0/3, tuned 3/3.
- OpenAI native tools: terse 1/3, tuned 3/3.
- OpenAI prompt JSON: terse 3/3, tuned 3/3.
- Gemini native tools: terse 0/3, tuned 3/3.
- Gemini prompt JSON: terse 0/3, tuned 3/3.

Zymtrace held-out tool/skill boundary run:

- Anthropic prompt JSON: stock 2/5, tuned 5/5.
- OpenAI prompt JSON: stock 2/5, tuned 5/5.
- Gemini prompt JSON: stock 2/5, tuned 5/5.
- The stock failures were default project UUIDs on project metrics calls and missing
  `meta_only=false` on selected full-trace drilldown. Tuned descriptions passed all held-out cells.

Screenpipe YC S26 local-activity run:

- Anthropic prompt JSON: README-level 6/7, source-level tuned 7/7.
- The tested slice covered broad activity recap, exact keyword lookup, speaker transcript search, UI
  element lookup, known frame context, pipe creation, and pipe log verification.
- The README-level miss chose `search-content` for exact keyword lookup. The source-level tuned
  variant chose `keyword-search`.
- Receipt: `evals/results/screenpipe_mcp_tool_selection_2026-06-28.md`.

YC P2026 MCP run:

- InsForge Anthropic prompt JSON: README-level 15/16, source-level tuned 16/16.
- Humwork Anthropic prompt JSON: README-level 7/7, skill-tuned 7/7.
- OpenWork Anthropic prompt JSON: docs-level 7/7, source-level tuned 7/7.
- InsForge produced the confirmed delta. Humwork and OpenWork remain guardrails without promotion.
- Receipts: `evals/results/insforge_mcp_tool_selection_2026-06-28.md`,
  `evals/results/humwork_mcp_tool_selection_2026-06-28.md`, and
  `evals/results/openwork_ui_mcp_tool_selection_2026-06-28.md`.

Additional guardrail slices were added for the partial check families on 2026-06-25. These are
not promoted as new upstream improvements by themselves. They are live tuned-variant regression
cases for error recovery, output budget, resource or metadata-first routing, and no-tool safety.

- Firecrawl Anthropic prompt JSON tuned variant: 3/3. Cases cover concise JSON scrape, JavaScript
  scrape error recovery to `firecrawl_interact`, and URL index discovery with `firecrawl_map`.
- Supabase Anthropic prompt JSON tuned variant: 3/3. Cases cover unknown relation recovery to
  `list_tables`, concise non-verbose table inventory, and metadata before `SELECT *`.
- ClickHouse Anthropic prompt JSON tuned variant: 3/3. Cases cover unknown table recovery to
  `list_tables`, exploratory `LIMIT 5`, and metadata before analytical SQL.
- GitHub Anthropic prompt JSON tuned variant: 4/4. Cases cover 404 path recovery to `search_code`,
  `perPage=5` pull request listing, workflow metadata via `actions_get`, and destructive repository
  deletion as `NO_TOOL`.
- Zymtrace Anthropic prompt JSON tuned variant with skill rules: 3/3. Cases cover full-trace error
  recovery to metadata discovery, bounded `hot_traces`, and fallback `topfunctions` in the tool-only
  resource matrix.
- Context7 Anthropic prompt JSON tuned variant: 3/3. Cases cover invalid ID recovery to
  `resolve-library-id`, focused exact-ID docs query, and selected ID bypassing the resolver.

ClickHouse adds a safety-oriented prompt-JSON matrix:

- Standard read-only tasks route to `list_databases`, `list_tables`, or `run_select_query`.
- Mutation tasks route to `NO_TOOL` because the visible official catalog is read-only.
- Live Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini prompt-JSON cells passed 42/42 across stock and tuned
  descriptions. That means no tuned ClickHouse wording is promoted yet.
- This is not yet a credentialed database execution result. The ClickHouse Cloud API key proves
  control-plane access. End-to-end MCP query traces also need database host/user/password.

Zymtrace adds a profiling-analysis matrix against an inspected `zymtrace-mcp` 26.6.1 surface and
the installed Zymtrace optimization skills:

- The live MCP endpoint advertises 25 tools.
- The live MCP endpoint advertises 3 resources: `topfunctions`, `topentities`, and `flamegraph`.
- The rerun found a real tuning miss in the first Zymtrace matrix: the live server says to prefer
  resources before same-named tools, use default project
  `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` unless the user explicitly asks for another project, and
  reserve `projects_search` for project listing/search/switching.
- The installed Zymtrace CPU/GPU skills add workflow boundaries: CPU rank-first requests start with
  `topentities` or `topfunctions`. GPU and inference investigations start with metric discovery.
  Call-tree analysis prefers first-pass `hot_traces` with `meta_only=true`. Full trace drilldown
  requires a selected `prefix_hash`, `meta_only=false`, and `limit=1`.
- The tuned variant now encodes those boundaries plus metrics discovery before metrics query,
  high-level versus project JSON flamegraphs, recommendations, and raw event APIs only when
  explicitly requested.
- The inspected profiler is CPU/eBPF-ready. GPU profiling is not treated as available until the
  Zymtrace license reports GPU support.
- The 2026-06-30 rerun enabled the commercial Zymtrace license in the local Docker Compose install.
  The profiler changed from `SupportsGpu:false` to `SupportsGpu:true`, detected an NVIDIA B200, and
  exported hardware GPU metrics through the MCP.
- The expanded held-out live run promoted the tuned Zymtrace wording as a confirmed provider win:
  stock passed 14/24 cells, while tuned passed 24/24 across Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini prompt
  JSON cells. Evidence lives in
  `evals/results/zymtrace_mcp_matrix_live_2026-06-30.json` and
  `evals/pr_packets/zymtrace_mcp_tool_tuning_2026-06-30/`.
- Additional live findings are captured in `docs/findings/zymtrace/README.md`: unfiltered
  `hot_traces` can rank idle first, `topentities` can expose `zymtrace-profiler` as self-noise, and
  GPU readiness would benefit from a single MCP status path.
