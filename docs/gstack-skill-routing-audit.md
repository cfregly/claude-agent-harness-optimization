# gstack Skill Routing Audit

Checked through 2026-07-01.

> [!NOTE]
> This page starts with the human summary. Detailed eval, command, and machine-readable material is preserved below.

## Summary

| Before | After | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `gstack_stock_skill_descriptions` scored 0.975. Baseline focus: careful-mode, browser-headless. | `gstack_boundary_tuned_skill_descriptions` scored 0.992, a 0.017 gain. | Apply this change: Clarify browser alias and safety-mode skill routing boundaries. Add retained cases as regression coverage. |

## Recommended Actions

- Apply this change: Clarify browser alias and safety-mode skill routing boundaries.
- Add the 30 retained routing cases to upstream CI or release-blocking regression coverage.
- Keep the passing cells visible so maintainers preserve behavior that already works.

## Model Coverage

Provider/model rows are evidence lanes. The target repo actions above are the only primary CTA.

## Public Summary

- Outcome: Confirmed improvement.
- Focus: browser and safety skill routing.
- Baseline: `gstack_stock_skill_descriptions` at 0.975.
- Candidate: `gstack_boundary_tuned_skill_descriptions` at 0.992.
- Delta: 0.017 against a 0.010 minimum.

## Human Summary

The pinned gstack packet still has a confirmed baseline-to-tuned improvement on the original
720-cell sweep. It now also has a current available-frontier stress receipt for OpenAI `gpt-5.5`
and Gemini `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools`: [gstack_skill_matrix_frontier_available_live_2026-07-01.md](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/blob/main/evals/results/gstack_skill_matrix_frontier_available_live_2026-07-01.md).

That current receipt completed 496 live cells with 484 passed, 8 failed, and 4 errors. Treat it as
hill-descending evidence for the next tuning pass. Anthropic Opus is now retained in a separate receipt. The new key passed smoke testing, then later calls hit credit exhaustion where shown in the receipt.

```

Gemini was rerun after increasing its matrix `max_tokens` to `4096`. The first full run showed
Gemini truncating prompt-JSON responses because internal thinking consumed the default output budget.
The current available-frontier command above is retained as the 2026-07-01 stress receipt.

High-profile smoke run:

```bash
python -m claude_agent_harness_opt model-matrix \
  evals/targets/gstack/gstack_skill_selection_matrix.json \
  --env-file .env --live --require-live \
  --providers anthropic-opus-high,openai-gpt54-high,gemini-25-pro-high \
  --harnesses prompt_json \
  --variants gstack_boundary_tuned_skill_descriptions \
  --instruction-variants boundary_routing_rules \
  --cases browser-headless,careful-mode \
  --concurrency 3 \
  --out evals/results/gstack_high_profile_smoke_2026-06-25.json
```

The first high-profile smoke exposed a real harness compatibility issue: Claude Opus rejected the
default `temperature` parameter. The harness now omits temperature unless a profile explicitly sets
it.

Native high-profile smoke run:

```bash
python -m claude_agent_harness_opt model-matrix \
  evals/targets/gstack/gstack_skill_selection_matrix.json \
  --env-file .env --live --require-live \
  --providers anthropic-opus-high,openai-gpt54-high,gemini-25-pro-high \
  --harnesses native_tools \
  --variants gstack_boundary_tuned_skill_descriptions \
  --instruction-variants boundary_routing_rules \
  --cases browser-headless \
  --concurrency 3 \
  --out evals/results/gstack_high_profile_native_smoke_2026-06-25.json
```

## Results

The original live result is a historical three-profile sweep. It covered one Anthropic profile, one
OpenAI profile, and one Gemini profile. The current available-frontier receipt below is the stronger
2026-07-01 stress surface for OpenAI and Gemini frontier profiles.

## Signals

What we learned:

- The generated gstack skill catalog is mostly well routed across the tested harnesses.
- Boundary tuning still adds measurable value on the pinned surface.
- The useful failures are adjacent-skill confusion, not broad quality failure.
- The current available-frontier run is retained as the next hill-descending surface.
- Anthropic frontier still requires a funded key before it can be claimed as complete.

Browser alias boundary:

- Failing case: `browser-headless`
- Expected: `gstack_browse`
- Observed wrong choice: `gstack_gstack`
- Affected cells: OpenAI native stock, OpenAI prompt-JSON stock and tuned, Gemini stock native and prompt-JSON.
- Interpretation: the broad generated `gstack` browser alias competes with the narrower `gstack-browse` skill. Boundary-tuned descriptions fix Anthropic and Gemini, but OpenAI prompt-JSON still chooses the alias.

Suggested upstream change:

- Do not expose the broad `gstack` alias as a normal selectable workflow skill when `gstack-browse` is also present, or mark it as a compatibility alias only.
- Add an explicit line to the alias description: "Do not select this for browser testing. Select `/browse` instead."

Safety-mode boundary:

- Failing cases: `careful-mode`, `freeze-edits`
- Expected: `gstack_careful` for destructive-command warnings, `gstack_freeze` for edit-scope locking.
- Observed wrong choice: `gstack_guard`.
- Interpretation: `/guard` is attractive because it includes both safety behaviors. The skill descriptions should say `/guard` is only for requests that explicitly ask for both destructive-command warnings and directory-scoped edit locking.

Suggested upstream change:

- Add examples to `/careful`, `/freeze`, and `/guard`.
- `/careful`: "Be careful while touching prod" means warnings only.
- `/freeze`: "Only edit this directory" means edit lock only.
- `/guard`: "Warn before destructive commands and lock edits to this directory" means both.

Gemini harness budget:

- First full run: Gemini prompt-JSON returned truncated JSON and empty native outputs in many cells.
- Probe result: `finishReason=MAX_TOKENS`, with most budget consumed by internal thinking.
- Fix: set Gemini matrix `max_tokens` to `4096`.
- Rerun result: 237/240 Gemini cells passed, 0 errors.
