# Model Matrix

The model matrix is the tuning layer for new model generations. It runs the same tool-selection
cases across provider profiles, harnesses, tool-description variants, and instruction variants.

Use it when changing:

- model id
- reasoning effort or thinking budget
- provider harness
- tool names
- tool descriptions
- argument schemas
- `CLAUDE.md`
- skills
- system prompts

## Why It Exists

Models do not read tool descriptions the same way. A description that works for one model can fail
on another model, or fail when moved from prompt JSON to native tool calling. The matrix makes that
visible before a prompt or tool change is promoted.

The pass bar is still adversarially-confirmed to add value. A tuned description should beat the
baseline on realistic cases, survive held-out cases, and avoid regressions on direct easy cases.

This repo treats the harness as a variable, not background plumbing. A harness can be provider
native tool calling, a prompt JSON wrapper, an Agent SDK loop, an IDE agent, or any runtime that can
export the same trace contract. The useful question is whether a model plus harness chooses the
right tool, passes the right arguments, reasons visibly between tool calls, and uses tool outputs
before the final answer.

## Included Matrix

`evals/model_matrix/coding_tool_selection.json` tests Claude Code style tools:

- `Task`: broad delegated investigation
- `Glob`: file path discovery
- `Grep`: content search
- `Read`: exact file read

The hard cases distinguish `Task` from `Grep`. Short descriptions often make models pick `Grep` for
broad investigation. Tuned descriptions state when to delegate to `Task` and when to stay with direct
file tools.

`evals/model_matrix/harness_trace_adapters.json` tests exported runtime traces as named harnesses:

- `agent_sdk_trace`: normalized Agent SDK style event exports
- `cursor_trace`: normalized IDE-agent style event exports
- `trace_fixture`: keyless provider that reads saved event files through an adapter

This matrix proves that exported harness runs can enter the same tool-selection contract as live
provider calls. It is also the smoke test for adapter changes.

## Commands

Dry run:

```bash
python -m claude_agent_harness_optimization model-matrix evals/model_matrix/coding_tool_selection.json --markdown
```

Smoke test one provider and a few cases:

```bash
python -m claude_agent_harness_optimization model-matrix evals/model_matrix/coding_tool_selection.json \
  --env-file .env \
  --live \
  --require-live \
  --providers anthropic \
  --harnesses native_tools \
  --variants tuned_boundaries \
  --instruction-variants boundary_rules \
  --max-cases 2 \
  --markdown
```

Full local sweep:

```bash
python -m claude_agent_harness_optimization model-matrix evals/model_matrix/coding_tool_selection.json \
  --env-file .env \
  --live \
  --require-live \
  --concurrency 8 \
  --markdown
```

Adapter smoke test:

```bash
python -m claude_agent_harness_optimization model-matrix evals/model_matrix/harness_trace_adapters.json \
  --live \
  --require-live \
  --providers trace_fixture \
  --harnesses agent_sdk_trace,cursor_trace \
  --variants exported_trace_tools \
  --instruction-variants exported_trace \
  --markdown
```

Hill-climb one hard boundary from a baseline:

```bash
python -m claude_agent_harness_optimization grind-harness evals/model_matrix/coding_tool_selection.json \
  --env-file .env \
  --live \
  --require-live \
  --providers anthropic,openai,gemini \
  --harnesses native_tools,prompt_json \
  --instruction-variants boundary_rules \
  --cases "investigate trace review flow,map model matrix implementation" \
  --heldout-cases "find python files,read known file" \
  --min-improvement 0.05 \
  --concurrency 8 \
  --max-live-calls 60 \
  --markdown
```

`grind-harness` runs the baseline, creates a candidate tool-description variant from the failed
cases, reruns the selected cells, confirms held-out cells, and promotes only if the live score
improves by the configured threshold without held-out regression. Dry runs are useful for checking
scope and call counts, but they do not satisfy the value bar.

This is the repo's autoresearch-style loop. It uses evals as the optimization surface and the
experiment log as the research record. Each iteration says which candidate was kept or rejected and
why.

## Reading Results

The report has one row per case and a cell summary grouped by:

- provider
- harness
- tool-description variant
- instruction variant

Use the cell summary to isolate the cause:

- If only one provider fails, tune the provider profile or model-specific instructions.
- If native tools fail but prompt JSON passes, tune provider tool schemas.
- If baseline fails and tuned passes, promote the tuned tool descriptions after held-out checks.
- If both variants fail, add harder schema guidance or split the tool.
- If instruction variants change the score, tune `CLAUDE.md`, skill instructions, or system prompt text.
- If trace fixture harnesses fail, fix the adapter or trace instrumentation before tuning prompts.

Use the same loop for `CLAUDE.md` and skill updates:

1. Add a narrow instruction variant that represents the proposed `CLAUDE.md` or skill wording.
2. Run a dry matrix to confirm the selected cells.
3. Run a live matrix or harness grind with `.env`.
4. Promote only when the candidate beats the baseline on target cells and does not regress held-out
   cells.
5. Add the failure as a named case so the next model generation can be retested.

## Live Result From June 24, 2026

Using local Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini keys, the matrix was run against:

- Anthropic `claude-sonnet-4-5`
- OpenAI `gpt-4.1`
- Gemini `gemini-2.5-pro`

Native tool harness:

- `baseline_short`: 72 of 84 passed
- `tuned_boundaries`: every provider and instruction variant scored 7 of 7

Prompt JSON harness:

- `baseline_short`: 73 of 84 passed
- `tuned_boundaries`: every provider and instruction variant scored 7 of 7

The repeated failure was the same useful one: short descriptions made models choose `Grep` for broad
repository investigation tasks that should use `Task`. Tuned boundary descriptions fixed that across
all three providers and both harnesses.

Gemini `prompt_json` initially failed because `maxOutputTokens` was too small for `gemini-2.5-pro`.
Increasing the profile output budget to 4096 removed those harness errors.

## Harness Grind Result From June 24, 2026

Using local Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini keys, `grind-harness` was run on the two broad
investigation cases that distinguish `Task` from `Grep`.

Selected cells:

- providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini
- harnesses: native tools and prompt JSON
- instruction variant: `boundary_rules`
- baseline variant: `baseline_short`

Result:

- baseline: 1 of 12 passed
- candidate: 12 of 12 passed
- improvement: 0.917
- promoted: yes
- value bar passed: yes

The repeated failure was that short descriptions made models choose `Grep` for broad repository
investigation. The generated candidate sharpened the `Task` boundary and passed all selected live
provider and harness cells.
