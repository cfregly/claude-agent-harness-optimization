name: agent-audit
description: Review an agent's tool inventory, tool calls, reasoning summaries, tool outputs, final answers, and value-bar proof using this repo's trace-review harness. Use when asked to audit, test, score, or review agent traces, Claude Messages API transcripts, tool schemas, trace suites, or agent audit bundles for tool-use quality, inter-tool reasoning, recovery behavior, final answer grounding, and whether the work is adversarially-confirmed to add value.

# Agent Audit

Use the repo's CLI to produce deterministic trace reviews before giving judgment, then run the live
Claude judge for real semantic audits. Prefer existing JSON artifacts over reconstructing a trace
from prose. Treat "adversarially-confirmed to add value" as the pass bar.

## Decision Tree

1. If the user asks whether tool descriptions or schemas cause bad tool choice, use `optimize-tools`.
2. If the user provides a tool inventory plus traces, use `audit-agent`.
3. If the user provides Agent SDK or IDE-agent event exports, use `normalize-runtime`, then review the normalized trace.
4. If the user asks about a new model, provider, reasoning mode, `CLAUDE.md`, or skill tuning, use `model-matrix`.
5. If matrix failures repeat across a harness or provider, use `grind-harness` with a live run and call cap.
6. If the user provides a regression suite, use `trace-suite`.
7. If the user provides one normalized trace, use `review-trace`.
8. If the user provides Claude Messages API content blocks, use `normalize-claude`, then review the normalized trace.
9. If the user provides raw prose or screenshots, ask for exported JSON unless a small manual trace can be built without guessing.
10. If an audit bundle lacks `value_bar`, treat it as failed until the value claim, baseline,
   candidate, threshold, and adversarial review are supplied.

## Commands

Run from the repo root.

python -m claude_agent_prompting trace-judge-prompt <trace.json>
```

Use JSON output when another program will consume the result. Use `--markdown` when reporting to a
human.

## Review Method

1. Run the deterministic command first.
2. Read the failed checks, grouped by `structure`, `tool_use`, `reasoning`, and `final`.
3. Inspect the trace around any failed check before proposing a fix.
4. Run `optimize-tools` when the failure involves wrong tools, missing arguments, duplicate calls, or vague tool boundaries.
5. Run `model-matrix` when the fix may vary by model, provider, harness, `CLAUDE.md`, skill, or system instruction.
6. Run `grind-harness` when a repeated matrix failure needs a candidate tool-description or harness instruction change.
7. Check the value bar. Do not pass an audit without baseline improvement and adversarial confirmation.
8. For real audits, run `--claude-judge` so Claude reviews visible reasoning
   summaries, tool outputs, tool descriptions, selection cases, final grounding, and value over baseline.
9. Recommend prompt or tool changes only when they map directly to a failed check or Claude judge
   finding.
10. Use `trace-judge-prompt` only when you need a portable judge prompt instead of a live Claude API
   call.

## What To Look For

- Tools: duplicate names, vague purposes, endpoint-shaped wrappers, missing `use_when` or
  `avoid_when`, missing `input_schema`, missing `output_schema`, missing `quality_checks`, missing
  context controls for large outputs, missing error guidance, overlapping search tools.
- Tool calls: wrong tool, missing required tool, forbidden tool, bad arguments, duplicate calls, over-budget calls.
- Metrics: missing runtime, token, tool-call count, or tool-error summaries from representative runs.
- Selection cases: missing verifiable outcomes, missing held-out cases, missing expected tools,
  missing forbidden tools, missing contrast between similar tools, missing rationale, exact tool
  order that overfits one valid strategy.
- Model matrix: provider-specific failures, native-tool failures, JSON-choice failures, baseline versus tuned description gaps, instruction variant regressions.
- Harness grind: repeated failures that can be turned into a candidate variant and retested live against the baseline.
- Tool outputs: missing result, result linked to no call, errors without recovery.
- Reasoning: no plan before the first tool, missing complexity, missing tool budget, missing
  evidence or stop criteria, no reflection after results, missing quality, missing verification, or
  missing continue or stop decision.
- Final answer: unsupported claims, missing uncertainty, failure to use gathered evidence.
- Value bar: missing value claim, missing baseline, weak delta, no adversarial challenge, open objections.

## Reporting

Lead with the result and score. Then list the highest-impact failed checks and the concrete change
that would address each one.

Use this format:

```text
Result: pass/fail, score X.XXX

Findings:
- [category] failed check: evidence from trace. Suggested change.

Commands run:
- ...
```

Do not claim hidden reasoning exists. Use visible thinking summaries, provider-returned thinking
blocks, or explicit decision notes. If reasoning is unavailable, say the trace is not instrumented
well enough to audit inter-tool reasoning.
