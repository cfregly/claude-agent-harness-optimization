description: Review an agent's tool inventory, tool calls, reasoning summaries, tool outputs, and final answers using this repo's trace-review harness. Use when asked to audit, test, score, or review agent traces, Claude Messages API transcripts, tool schemas, trace suites, or agent audit bundles for tool-use quality, inter-tool reasoning, recovery behavior, and final answer grounding.

# Agent Audit

Use the repo's CLI to produce deterministic trace reviews before giving judgment. Prefer existing
JSON artifacts over reconstructing a trace from prose.

## Decision Tree

1. If the user provides a tool inventory plus traces, use `audit-agent`.
2. If the user provides a regression suite, use `trace-suite`.
3. If the user provides one normalized trace, use `review-trace`.
4. If the user provides Claude Messages API content blocks, use `normalize-claude`, then review the normalized trace.
5. If the user provides raw prose or screenshots, ask for exported JSON unless a small manual trace can be built without guessing.

## Commands

Run from the repo root.

```bash
python -m claude_agent_prompting audit-agent <bundle.json> --markdown
python -m claude_agent_prompting trace-suite <suite.json> --markdown
python -m claude_agent_prompting review-trace <trace.json>
python -m claude_agent_prompting normalize-claude <messages.json>
python -m claude_agent_prompting trace-judge-prompt <trace.json>
```

Use JSON output when another program will consume the result. Use `--markdown` when reporting to a
human.

## Review Method

1. Run the deterministic command first.
2. Read the failed checks, grouped by `structure`, `tool_use`, `reasoning`, and `final`.
3. Inspect the trace around any failed check before proposing a fix.
4. Recommend prompt or tool changes only when they map directly to a failed check.
5. Use `trace-judge-prompt` for semantic questions the deterministic checks cannot decide.

## What To Look For

- Tools: duplicate names, vague purposes, missing `use_when` or `avoid_when`, overlapping search tools.
- Tool calls: wrong tool, missing required tool, forbidden tool, bad arguments, duplicate calls, over-budget calls.
- Tool outputs: missing result, result linked to no call, errors without recovery.
- Reasoning: no plan before the first tool, no reflection after results, no quality or evidence assessment.
- Final answer: unsupported claims, missing uncertainty, failure to use gathered evidence.

## Reporting

Lead with the result and score. Then list the highest-impact failed checks and the concrete change
that would address each one.

Use this format:

```text
Result: pass/fail, score X.XXX

Findings:
- [category] failed check: evidence from trace. Suggested change.

Commands run:
- ...
```

Do not claim hidden reasoning exists. Use visible thinking summaries, provider-returned thinking
blocks, or explicit decision notes. If reasoning is unavailable, say the trace is not instrumented
well enough to audit inter-tool reasoning.
